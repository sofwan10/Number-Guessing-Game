# Number-Guessing-Game
- Guessing a number is a fun game that involves us to relate the clues the system gives us. This fun, yet provoking game is a simple way to keep our mind stimulated.
- We will create a simple number guessing game using python and display the scores the player gets if he/she wins. This project will serve as an introduction to functions and creating GUI using Tkinter.

# Project Prerequisites
The project makes use of Tkinter for GUI, random module for generating random targets and clues. Since we use Tkinter which is a built-in GUI library in python, we check it by importing it

```
import tkinter
```
